# DoggyDays

The DoggyDays app was a project completed as an assignment from my participation in the Android Developer Cohort of the Google Fellowship Program. 
The goals was to build an app that displays an image of a dog using the API https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/.

The completed app needed to do the following:
Display a dog image (a jpg image is returned from calling the endpoint https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random)
Have a button that lets the user generate a new image

The main endpoint utilized for this app is: https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random 

The API response from that endpoint looks like the following:
{
    "message": "https://images.dog.ceo/breeds/briard/n02105251_7738.jpg",
    "status": "success"
}

You can read more about the specific endpoint here: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/random 

Topics learned during the development of this app include:
1. Understanding how to make web API requests using network calls
2. Understanding how to parse API responses 
3. Understanding how to load images from a network location and display them

Below is a visual of the final product
